## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For the first time I tried mobile-first approach and it was very fun. Adding media queries for desktop version afterwards is way much easier. 

Also, I practiced flexbox and its values. I got my head around it and I feel more comfortable with it.

Paddings and margins are something that I also have a better understanding of now. I must work from top to bottom to avoid mistakes. I love making a clean and readable code.

Note to self:  Take care of width and height in the future(auto, vh). Margins and padding for layout. Watch what is a container and what is an item while using flexbox and use borders to help you see the boxes while you work.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.
