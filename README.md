## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

For the first time I tried mobile-first approach and it was very fun. Adding media queries for desktop version afterwards is way much easier. 

Also, I practiced flexbox and its values. I got my head around it and I feel more comfortable with it.

Paddings and margins are something that I also have a better understanding of now. I must work from top to bottom to avoid mistakes. I love making a clean and readable code.

**Note to self:  Take care of width and height in the future(auto, vh).Use margins and padding for simpler layout (absolute positiong as well). Watch what is a container and what is an item while using flexbox and use borders to help you see the boxes while you work.**

### Continued development

I want to refine my HTML and CSS skills for now. I want to do some more challenges so I get experienced a bit more. Afterwards I am going to take on JavaScript.
